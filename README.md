# 🚀 Transport System in Python

This project simulates a real-world **transport management system** using Python’s Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It demonstrates class creation, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and constructors.

---

## 🧱 Key Concepts Covered

- ✅ **Class & Object Design**
- ✅ **Constructors & Unique Initialization**
- ✅ **Polymorphism**: `move()` method behaves differently across `Car`, `Plane`, and `Ship`
- ✅ **Encapsulation**: Private attributes in the `Ticket` class
- ✅ **Intermediate-Level Code**: Realistic use-case with user and vehicle objects

## 📌 Example Output

Tesla is driving smoothly on the road at 120 km/h. 🚗
Boeing 747 is flying in the sky at 850 km/h. ✈️
Titanic is sailing across the sea at 40 km/h. 🚢

--- Ticket Details ---
Passenger: Aghason Emmanuel
Vehicle: Boeing 747
Seat No: A21
